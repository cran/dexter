# dexter 0.8.1

* significant speed increases in plausible_values, plausible_scores, ability and ability_tables
* added plot method for the extended nominal response model
* new function `add_response_data()` for importing normalized data

# dexter 0.8.0

* `profiles()` and `profile_tables()` functions added for analysis of individual deviation profiles
  (misfit) compared to the fitted model.

* bugfix for solaris

* You may want to take a look at the new sister package, dextergui


# dexter 0.7.0

* support for RSQLite release 2.1.0+ which broke dexter 0.6.0. 

* `probability_to_pass()` function added for equating to a reference test that is 
  connected to a target test.


# dexter 0.6.0

* `ability_tables()` function added to generate score transformation tables 
  for arbitrary subsets of items. `ability()` and `ability_tables()` can now also 
  take Jeffreys prior and variatons of the normal prior and can optionally 
  output standard errors.
  
* `plausible_scores()` function added to generate scores on arbitrary itemsets
  (or the entire bank). 
  
* Updates to documentation.


# dexter 0.5.1

* `plausible_values()` can now work with covariates. 

* `fit_enorm()` can optionally take fixed_parameters into account. 

* Significant speed increases in profile_plot, iTIA and iModels and minor speed increases in other functions.

* Further includes more user control over plotting parameters, updates to documentation, several bugfixes and some
  smaller updates.


# dexter 0.4.4

* included Rdpack in Imports at the request of CRAN, and fixed 4 minor bugs

# dexter 0.4.2

We go straight from version 0.1.7 to version 0.4.2 in a major new release.
The functionality envisaged for two other related packages, enorm and 
roger, has now been all incorporated into dexter.

* The database has been completely rewritten. Databases created with 0.1.7 can
  be imported but are no longer maintained.
  
* Many functions now support flexible subsetting of data through a predicate
  expression; furthermore, the data source can be either the dexter database
  (more usual), or a data frame or tibble. The latter can be useful in simple
  simulations or in some non-standard situations.
  
* Basic test and item analysis has been extended with two interactive tools
  based on shiny, and with an exploratory tool to search for DIF. 

* Version 0.4.2 estimates the Extended NOminal Response Model (ENORM) by
  either CML or a Gibbs sampler, computes person scores by either MLE, EAP,
  or plausible values, and provides a new test for the hypothesis of no true
  individual differences. In addition, it supports a method for standard
  settings known as 3DC. 

* Several vignettes have been added to explain the new features in detail.
